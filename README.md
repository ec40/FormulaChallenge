# FormulaChallenge

This program gives the rules and answers to a simple maths game inspired by reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/mathpics/comments/q66h2f/i_created_this_puzzle_where_using_only_4_digits/

The game is to create a formula using the four basic operators which will result in each positive integer between 0 and a number of the users choosing.  You don't have to use each number and can use a number as many times as you like.

The user gets to decide how many digits they would like to use(i.e 1-9), they can also decide whether to choose random or specified digits.  

The program outputs to a csv with each formula and outputs the maximum amount of operators used to generate each integer. The goal being to beat the program by using less operators than it does.

Future development of this program will include trying to find and predict the optimal(least operators used) set or sets of digits for every positive integer.
